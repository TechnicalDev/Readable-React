# Readable-React

Readable Blog - Created using ReactJS for Udacity's React Nanodegree program

## Loading the App

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter.  If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git clone https://github.com/TechnicalDev/Readable-React.git

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the application
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

```
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
